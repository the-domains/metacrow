Take on the role of a tester. Go play a game and observe yourself as you play. Write down what you're doing and feeling. Try to create one page of detailed notes on your behaviors and actions. Then repeat this experience while watching a friend play the same game. Compare the two sets of notes and analyze what you've learned from the process. 

Ori and the Blind Forest 

My playthrough:
The opening graphics make an impact, and the audio draws me in. I was surprised to see I was controlling Naru at first. The paintings on the wall made me smile.
The prologue was dramatic, and definitely put me in a very specific mood. The transition to exploration was well done. The inaccessible areas made it apparent that I should expect further ability upgrades, even before the tech tree showed up. I generally found myself looking for a way to access a specific function, like the map, right about the time the tutorial told me how to do it.
The bright colors everywhere made it difficult for me to see the attacks of my enemies, which translated to not being able to dodge them. Mildly frustrating, but the seamless save functionality, and the painlessness of dying made it mostly a non-issue for me.
It was a little frustrating to see areas specifically designed to make my backtrack later, when I had newer abilities.
The wall jumping was a little finicky.
Overall, the pacing was faster than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise. The narration was well done, although perhaps slightly thicker font.
The energy mechanics weren't explained, and it caused a little bit of frustration when i found I was locked out of things because I used my Charge Blast for fun.
The presentation and story are enough to keep my involved for short periods, but not long ones.

Christy's playthrough:
In general, she noticed more of the details than I did. The title screen camera shifted around slowly and subtly. The particle effects on Ori are falling leaves. The mushrooms on the ground ruffled against you when you walked by. She played with them for a bit, along with other background objects. The cursor was 'ooh shiny'.
She checked the controls first, but didn't remember most of them. The Prelude had very smooth transitions between 'movie' and 'gameplay', and she had trouble knowing when she was in control of the player. Diagonal jumping was difficult for her, but I think that's a normal issue for her in all games. The jump height messages weren't helpful, since she was already holding shift to maximize jump height. Wall jumping was almost impossible for her though, and caused her to quit the game a couple times.
The tutorials weren't forceful enough, and she skipped through them quickly, and forgot them. This led to her frequently not saving, and having to replay large sections. Ability points went completely over her head. The puzzles quickly became frustrating, since her manual dexterity with the keyboard wasn't able to keep up. Perhaps a controller would work better for her.
She learned the mechancis through dying, and laugh quite a bit at first. She knew when objects were important, and tried to interact with them tenaciously, even when the tool she needed to unlock them was just around the next corner.
Overall, I think the tutorials were targeted as a less casual gamer, and she could have used a more invasive tutorial... along with a controller.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8dd8d1cf-99cd-4fdb-aeb8-474f8218c539.jpg)
